# CoMote Max example
by ISMM Team @ Ircam - STMS (https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/interaction-son-musique-mouvement)


CoMote allows for streaming motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope) from the smartphone to desktop applications using either the OSC protocol or Websockets. The network's setup is facilitated by the use of a QR code generated by the targeted remote application receiving the motion sensor data.
    
CoMote is especially designed for the CoMo applications family that enables real-time interaction between gestures/movements and sounds. Nevertheless, the CoMote application can be used with any software that makes use of the OSC protocol.

Among the CoMo applications that make use of CoMote are CoMo-Vox to learn and train conducting gestures, and CoMo-Elements to interact collectively thought body movements with recorded sounds.

CoMote and the CoMo applications are software designed and developed by IRCAM in the Sound-Music-Movement-Interaction team (UMR STMS).
